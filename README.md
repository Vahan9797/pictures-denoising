Simple project with Express.js and React

run `bash build.sh` or `./build.sh` and go to your browser's localhost:8080.

IMPORTANT: You can also run the build with `sh build.sh`, just make sure you execute it with bash interpretator, not dash. Dash is shit.

For adding newly created scss to index file before compiling it, run same command with `--scss` argument.
