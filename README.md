Simple project with Express.js and React

run `bash build.sh` or `./build.sh` and go to your browser's localhost:8080.

IMPORTANT: `sh build.sh` will lead to an error as it doesn't have `declare` in it's syntax.

for adding newly created scss to index file before compiling it, run same command with `--scss` argument.
